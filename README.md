# File_Duplicates_checker
Simple script to check for files duplicates


There are two scripts,
One of them writes the results to an Excel file, and you choose where to save it through Excel.
The other script, will save the results to CSV, and will save to a location you give in the beggining of the script.


I'll add some other features in the future.

For now, it checks file uniqueness by MD5 Hash
